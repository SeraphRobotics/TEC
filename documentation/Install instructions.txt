1. You will need to change twi.h in your arduino folder. 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\libraries\Wire\utility
Change the line
#define TWI_FREQ 100000L   to   #define TWI_FREQ 50000L

This lowers I2C frequency. The LCD module doesnt seem to like 100Khz.

2. Attached are extra libraries I used for the code so you dont have to download them. They should be placed in the arduino/libraries folder so they are always available to you
